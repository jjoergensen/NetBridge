# NetBridge
NetBridge is a .NET component for calling between different .NET environments and processes using gRPC and named pipes. It provides a simple way to achieve process isolation. NetBridge can be used to connect different versions of .NET Framework and .NET Core (.NET 6+) or to call between different processes in the same .NET environment.
